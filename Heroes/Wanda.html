        <pre>Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
            The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. Her first appearance was in The X-Men #4 (March 1964) 
            in the Silver Age of Comic Books. Originally said to have the ability to alter probability, the Scarlet Witch has been depicted
             as a powerful sorceress since the 1980s and on occasion has become powerful enough to alter reality by tapping into greater energy sources.

            The Scarlet Witch is first depicted as a reluctant supervillain along with her twin brother, Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver, 
            both founding members of the Brotherhood of Mutants. A year after her debut, she joined the Avengers superhero team and ever 
            since has often been depicted as a regular member of that or related teams (such as the West Coast Avengers and Force Works). 
            In 1975, she married her android teammate Vision, later using borrowed magical forces to make herself pregnant, resulting in twin 
            sons William ("Billy") and Thomas (“Tommy”). Stories in 1989 wiped Tommy and Billy from existence (they would later reappear as 
            the heroes called Wiccan and Speed) and removed Vision's emotions, leading to the annulment of his and Wanda's marriage.
            
            For most of her comic book history, the Scarlet Witch is portrayed as a mutant, a member of a fictional subspecies of humans 
            born with an "X-gene" that grants superhuman abilities and traits, although multiple stories also said the nature of her mutant 
            powers were influenced by the High Evolutionary experimenting on her when she was a child. A 2015 storyline revised Wanda's origin, 
            establishing that her superhuman traits are entirely a result of experimentation done by the High Evolutionary and on inherited
             magic abilities. Like Franklin Richards and other characters, her genetics were such that standard X-gene tests gave a false
              positive, meaning she was never actually born a mutant.
              
              The character's in-universe backstory and parentage have changed more than once. During the 1960s, she and Quicksilver are said to be the mutant twin offspring of two unnamed parents. Later, it is said the children were given to the geneticist called the High Evolutionary, leaving their true parentage a mystery. In 1974, it is said their parents are Golden Age heroes Bob Frank / Whizzer and Madeline Joyce Frank / Miss America. Wanda then refers to herself as Wanda Frank for a time. In 1979, they are revealed to have been raised by human Romani parents, Django and Marya Maximoff. In 1982, Magneto concludes he is Wanda and Pietro's father. In 2014, the AXIS crossover revealed Pietro and Wanda are not related to Magneto.</pre>
